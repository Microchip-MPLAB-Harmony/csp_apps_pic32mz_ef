# ADCHS polling

This example application shows how to sample an analog input using the ADCHS peripheral and displays the converted samples on a serial terminal.

## Description

In this application, an analog input is converted by a hardware trigger generated by the TMR peripheral. Converted digital value is displayed on the serial terminal.

### Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with FPU (EF) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320007)

- Connect the AN3 pin RB3 (Pin 15 of the J12) to the Vcc (Pin 1 of the J12)
- Connect the COM port J11(USB to UART) to the computer using a mini USB cable
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a mini USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console displays the ADC count and the ADC input voltage

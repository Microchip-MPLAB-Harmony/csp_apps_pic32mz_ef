# RTCC alarm interrupt

This example application shows how to use the RTCC to configure the time and generate the alarm.

## Description

This example application shows how to setup RTCC time and configure alarm using the RTCC Peripheral Library. The application sets up an alarm to be generated every day at a specified time. A message is sent via the Virtual COM port on the alarm trigger.

### Setting up [PIC32MZ Embedded Connectivity with FPU (EF) Starter Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320007)

- Connect mini USB cables from the ‘Debug USB’ and ‘USB-to-UART’ connectors on the board to the computer

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the "USB to UART" COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
4. Console output will be as given below in the beginning:

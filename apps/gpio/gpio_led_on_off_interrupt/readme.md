# GPIO interrupt

This example application demonstrate how to generate GPIO interrupt on switch press and release, and indicate the switch status using the LED.

## Description

This application uses the GPIO Peripheral library to generate callback on switch press and release, and drives the GPIO pin connected to the LED to indicate the switch status. The LED is turned ON when the switch is pressed and turned OFF when the switch is released.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_pic32mz_ef) and click

# CORETIMER periodic interrupt

This example application shows how to use the CoreTimer to generate periodic interrupts.

## Description

This example application configures the CoreTimer Peripheral Library to generate periodic interrupts. The application registers a periodic timeout callback. It toggles an LED every time the callback is triggered.

THE FOREGOING STATES THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY OF THE PARTIES FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT. . | Confidentiality. . (a) Licensee agrees that the Software (including but not limited to the Source Code, Object Code and library files) and its derivatives, Documentation and underlying inventions, algorithms, know-how and ideas relating to the Software and the Documentation are proprietary information belonging to Microchip and its licensors (“Proprietary Information”). Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary Information and shall similarly bind its employees and Third Party(ies) in writing. Proprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party can demonstrate was developed by it independently and without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure.

    "title": "Cache maintenance operations",
    "content": ". Cache maintenance operations . This example demonstrates the cache maintenance operation by cleaning and invalidating the cache for the DMA buffers located in the cacheable SRAM region. . Description . This example application shows how to use the cache maintenance APIs to avoid issues related to cache coherency when the data cache is enabled. . The application uses the USART and the DMA PLIBs to demonstrate the cache maintenance APIs provided by the Cache peripheral library. It registers a callback with the DMA transmit and receive channels. The application first transmits a message using the DMA transmit channel and then schedules a read of ten characters using the DMA receive channel. Once the DMA read is complete, it reads the received data and echoes the same on the terminal using the DMA transmit channel. . The application calls the DCACHE_CLEAN_BY_ADDR API on the write buffer before transmitting it. Calling this API copies the data from the cache memory to the main memory, thereby ensuring that the DMA peripheral uses the updated values in the write buffer. . The application calls the DCACHE_INVALIDATE_BY_ADDR API on the read buffer after reception of data is complete by the DMA receive channel. Calling this API invalidates the cache region corresponding to the read buffer, thereby ensuring that the CPU reads the updated values in the read buffer from the main memory and into the cache. . The cache maintenance operations are always performed on a cache line (1 cache line = 32 bytes), the read and write buffers must be aligned to a 32 byte boundary and must be a multiple of 32 bytes. For the same reason, the number of received and echoed back bytes is 10, the size of the receive and echo buffers is 32 bytes. . Downloading and building the application .

This example shows the transmit and receive operation over a SPI interface in a non-blocking manner. The peripheral interrupt is used to manage the transfer.The example application transmits known values from an array and verifies the data received through the loop back by comparing the transmitted data and the received data. The example application performs the loop back test only once after a power on reset. After the loop back is complete, the status of the loop back is indicated and the application remains idle. The loop back test requires the MOSI output pin to be connected to the MISO input pin so that anything transmitted will also be received. . Downloading and building the application .
